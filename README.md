Project 1
=========
This is a script to create a series of numbered folders from a prefix, with the correct number of zeros appended so they sort correctly. I chose to go with the "create a script for an action you do every day." idea. I don't use this quite every day, but I use it semi-regularly, especially to create folders for new classes.



Lab 5
======

This script counts letters, consonants, and vowels (A, E, I, O, & U) in a word.
