Project 2
=========

This is a script to display a log file to a web page.<br>
<br>
This is the path for the script: ./Labs/project2.js<br>
This is the path for index.html and the log file to be displayed (rando.log): ./Labs/public/<br>

Copy the files to disk, maintaining the hierarchy<br>
<br>
Run the script from a powershell script using the following command from the directory containing project2.js:<br>
<br>
node project2.js &lt;enter&gt;<br>
<br>
This will create a server accessible from a web browser at http://localhost:3000/public/rando.log<br>
<br>
Click the "Show Log" link to view the log file.

Project 1
=========
This is a script to create a series of numbered folders from a prefix, with the correct number of zeros appended so they sort correctly. I chose to go with the "create a script for an action you do every day." idea. I don't use this quite every day, but I use it semi-regularly, especially to create folders for new classes.



Lab 5
======

This script counts letters, consonants, and vowels (A, E, I, O, & U) in a word.
